# Arduino_NeoPower

This library allows a microcontroller board to control a nearly unlimited number of DC motors with only one GPIO pin.<br/>
Precondition is only that the microcontroller board is supported by the Adafruit_Neopixel library.

For more information about this library and the necessary hardware, please refer to the NeoPower documentation at <br/>
